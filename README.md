Maybe project name should be more fancy. This is repo for cas-offinder update to handle vcf file

**Introduction**

Genome editing nucleases are capable of precisely cleaving the DNA at a specific target site within the genome. 
The accuracy in identifying the exact target sequence plays a crucial role in determining the success of genetic manipulation. 
CRISPR genome editing has demonstrated its potential to treat genetic diseases such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, 
and muscular dystrophy by targeting and correcting the genetic abnormalities responsible for these conditions. However, 
one challenge regarding CRISPR genome editing is its off-target effect. Using reference genomes alone to predict potential 
off-target sites can have drawbacks. These genomes are usually based on a small number of individuals and may not 
capture the full genetic diversity within a species. In this study, we report an upgrade of Cas-OFFinder, a computational tool 
for identifying potential off-target sites based on not only considering a reference genome but also individual genetic variants.
